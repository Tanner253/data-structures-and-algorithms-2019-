## Binary tree
#### *Author: Tanner PErcival*

------------------------------

## Description
***Binary tree is a data structure that is connected by the root each containing a left and right child until "leaves" are found***

A C# implimentation of a binary tree. each node in the tree is connected by two children, like branches of a tree, until the last child nodes are found, or all the leaves are found.

## Methods

| Method | Summary | Big O Time | Big O Space | Example | 
| :----------- | :----------- | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------- |
| Preorder | traverses Tree in pre order | O(1) | O(1) | RecursiveBinarySearchPre(Node node) |
| inOrder | traverses a tree IN order| O(n) | O(1) | RecursiveBinarySearchInOrder(Node node) |
| postorder | Traverses a tree in Post o rder | O(n) | O(1) | RecursiveBinarySearchPostOrder(Node node) |
BINARY SEARCH TREE is O(log n)
						O(n)
