# Lecture Notes: Merge Sort

The Merge sort is a non-space efficient sort but is really fast!
The merge sort will allow you to sort an aray of methods quickly, but if space efficiency is what you're after then merge sort is not the one for you!


## Learning Objectives

## Algorithm
Why Merge sort over another sort? if you are unsure of the data coming back your merge sort will always be O(nlogn) which is really fast where a quick sort will be O(n^2), but is an in place method.
The overall idea of a merge sort is to break verything down into array's that are already sorted (an array of 1 value, is sorted) and re merging them back together in a fashion that is in-order.


Describe in detail how the algorithm works.
Include small code snippets to possibly support the points
